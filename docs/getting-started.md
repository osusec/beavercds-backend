# Getting Started

## Installation

Install `beavercds` via Cargo or install from source:

## Via `cargo`

`beavercds` is not published to Crates.io (yet), you will need to install
directly from git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/osusec/beavercds-ng
```

## Future plans

We do not provide releases with precompiled binaries yet, but we intend to in
the future so that users will not need to compile from git source.

## Next Steps

After installing the `beavercds` binary, get started with [setting up the
challenges repo](/guides/infra-quickstart) or [writing challenges](/guides/challenge-quickstart).
